## ðŸ”´ **Critical Missing Integrations**

### **1. Deletion Functionality (BROKEN)**
**Status**: Backend complete, frontend integration missing
**Problem**: Users can select photos for deletion but nothing happens when they click delete buttons
**Files Affected**:
- `PhotoGallery.tsx` - Delete buttons don't call deletion service
- `DuplicateModal.tsx` - Delete actions just log to console
- `App.tsx` - TrashBin component not integrated

**Required Work**:
```typescript
// In PhotoGallery.tsx
const handleDeleteSelected = async () => {
  const success = await deletionService.moveToTrash(selectedPhotoIds, photos)
  if (success) {
    // Remove from state and update UI
  }
}

// In App.tsx
import TrashBin from './components/TrashBin'
// Add TrashBin component to main app
```

### **2. TrashBin Component Not Integrated**
**Status**: Component complete but not used in main App
**Problem**: Users cannot access trash functionality despite it being fully implemented
**Required Work**:
- Add TrashBin component to App.tsx
- Add floating trash icon with file count
- Connect to deletion service for real-time updates

### **3. Database Integration Disconnect**
**Status**: Critical architecture issue
**Problem**: Frontend processes everything in browser only, backend database stays empty
**Impact**: Backend API endpoints return empty results because frontend doesn't populate database
**Required Work**:
- Sync processed photos to backend database during analysis
- API calls to save photo metadata and analysis results
- Bridge browser-based processing with server-side storage

## ðŸŸ¡ **Backend-Frontend Connection Issues**

### **4. Auto-Selection Not Used**
**Status**: Feature implemented but ignored
**Problem**: Quality analysis generates auto-selected photo IDs but UI doesn't use them
**Location**: `DirectorySelector.tsx` generates `autoSelectedIds` but `PhotoGallery.tsx` doesn't consume them
**Required Work**:
- Pass auto-selected IDs from DirectorySelector to PhotoGallery
- Pre-select photos identified as blurry/low-quality in the UI
- Add visual indicators for auto-selected photos

### **5. Progress Reporting Inconsistencies**
**Status**: Duplicate systems
**Problem**: Backend has scan progress API endpoint, frontend uses local progress tracking
**Impact**: No integration between backend progress and frontend display
**Required Work**:
- Unify progress reporting systems
- Use backend API for progress updates when applicable

## ðŸŸ  **Incomplete Feature Integration**

### **6. RAW+JPEG Pairing Display Issues**
**Status**: Logic complete, UI incomplete
**Problem**: UI shows pairing badges but no dedicated workflow for managing pairs
**Impact**: Users can see paired files but can't efficiently manage them
**Enhancement Ideas**:
- Dedicated paired files view
- Smart deletion (delete RAW when keeping JPEG, or vice versa)
- Pair management actions (unlink, prefer RAW, prefer JPEG)

### **7. Batch Operations Missing**
**Status**: Selection UI exists, batch actions missing
**Problem**: Users can select multiple photos but no bulk operations available
**Required Work**:
- Bulk delete functionality
- "Delete all blurry photos" action
- "Keep best from each duplicate group" action
- Multi-group duplicate management

## ðŸ”µ **Missing Core Functionality**

### **8. Keyboard Navigation**
**Status**: Not implemented
**Enhancement**: Professional keyboard shortcuts
**Suggested Features**:
- Arrow keys for navigation
- Spacebar for selection
- Delete key for deletion
- Escape to cancel operations
- Enter to confirm actions

### **9. Undo System**
**Status**: Not implemented
**Impact**: Users fear permanent deletion
**Suggested Implementation**:
- Undo recent actions before emptying trash
- Toast notifications with undo buttons
- Session-based undo history

### **10. Export Functionality**
**Status**: Not implemented
**Enhancement**: Professional workflow features
**Suggested Features**:
- Export CSV/PDF reports of cleaning actions
- Export selected photos to new directory
- Generate summary statistics
